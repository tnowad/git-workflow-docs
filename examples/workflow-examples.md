# Workflow Examples

In this document, we will explore some common Git workflows used in software development projects. These examples will guide you through the steps involved in various scenarios, such as feature development, bug fixing, and release management.

## Workflow 1: Feature Development

### Step 1: Create a New Branch

To start working on a new feature, create a new branch based on the main development branch (e.g., `develop` or `master`). Use a descriptive name that reflects the feature being developed.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
```

### Step 2: Work on the Feature

Make the necessary changes and commits in the new feature branch. Regularly sync with the main development branch to incorporate any updates from other team members.

### Step 3: Push the Branch

Once the feature is complete, push the feature branch to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Step 4: Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main development branch. Provide a detailed description of the changes and any relevant information for reviewers.

## Workflow 2: Bug Fixing

### Step 1: Identify the Bug

Identify the bug that needs to be fixed. It can be based on customer reports, issue tracker, or internal testing.

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch based on the main development branch, specifically for fixing the bug. Use a descriptive name that reflects the bug being addressed.

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-bug develop
```

### Step 3: Fix the Bug

Make the necessary code changes to fix the bug. Test the fix to ensure it resolves the issue.

### Step 4: Push the Branch

Push the bugfix branch to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin bugfix/fix-bug
```

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request to merge the bugfix branch into the main development branch. Include details about the bug, the fix, and any relevant information for reviewers.

## Workflow 3: Release Management

### Step 1: Create a Release Branch

Create a release branch based on the stable branch (e.g., master). Use a version number or a descriptive name for the release.

```bash
git checkout -b release/1.0.0 master
```

### Step 2: Perform Release-related Tasks

Perform tasks such as finalizing documentation, updating version numbers, and preparing release notes.

### Step 3: Test and Stabilize

Test the release branch thoroughly to ensure its stability. Address any issues or bugs that arise during the testing phase.

### Step 4: Merge into Stable Branch

Once the release branch is stable, merge it into the stable branch (e.g., master).

```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git push origin master --tags
```

### Step 5: Cleanup

Delete the release branch and perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

```bash
git branch -d release/1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/1.0.0
```

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples of Git workflows commonly used in software development projects. Remember to adapt and customize them based on the specific needs and practices of your team and project.
