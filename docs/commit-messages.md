# Commit Message Guidelines

## Introduction

Consistent and descriptive commit messages are essential for maintaining a clean and organized version history. This guide will provide you with guidelines for writing meaningful commit messages that follow our team's conventions.

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message should consist of a header, an optional body, and an optional footer. The header has a specific format that includes a type, an optional scope, and a brief description.

```xml
<type>(<scope>): <description>
<BLANK LINE>
[optional body]
<BLANK LINE>
[optional footer]
```

## Header

The header includes a type, an optional scope, and a brief description.

### Type

The type indicates the purpose of the commit. It helps categorize the changes and provides a quick summary. Some commonly used types are:

- feat: A new feature or enhancement.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation changes.
- style: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation).
- refactor: Code changes that do not affect the behavior or functionality.
- test: Adding or modifying tests.
- chore: Other changes not related to code (e.g., build tasks, dependencies).

### Scope

The scope is optional and represents the module, component, or section of the codebase related to the commit. It provides additional context and helps narrow down the focus of the changes.

### Description

The description provides a concise summary of the changes introduced by the commit. It should be clear and meaningful.

## Body (Optional)

The body provides more detailed information about the changes made in the commit. It can include the motivation behind the changes, additional context, and any relevant details.

## Footer (Optional)

The footer is used to reference issues or provide other related information. For example, it can include a reference to a GitHub issue or a breaking change notice.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of well-formed commit messages:

- feat(user): Add login functionality
  - Adds the login feature for the user module.
- fix(validation): Fix email validation regex
  - Fixes the regular expression used for email validation in the validation module.
- docs(readme): Update installation instructions
  - Updates the installation instructions in the README file.
- chore(dependencies): Update package dependencies
  - Updates the project's package dependencies.

## Conclusion

By following these commit message guidelines, we can ensure that our version history remains organized and easy to understand. Consistent commit messages improve collaboration and help in maintaining a clean and transparent development process.
